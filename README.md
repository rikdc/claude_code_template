# Claude Code Template

A Claude Code marketplace of seven plugins. Two are security hooks: one scans
MCP traffic for secrets, the other stops you editing protected branches
directly. The rest are skills and commands for Go work, git workflow, code
review, project management, and prompt engineering.

Install only the plugins you want, or clone the repository and work on them.

## Installation

Add the marketplace, then install plugins from it:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add rikdc/ai-skills

claude plugin install security-hooks@claude-code-template
claude plugin install dev-skills@claude-code-template
claude plugin install git-workflow@claude-code-template
claude plugin install pm-tools@claude-code-template
claude plugin install code-quality@claude-code-template
claude plugin install prompt-tools@claude-code-template
claude plugin install pr-review-triage@claude-code-template
```

The `/plugin` command does the same thing from inside a session.

Hooks only take effect after a Claude Code restart.

### Clone for local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rikdc/ai-skills.git
cd ai-skills
make install
make test
```

## Available plugins

| Plugin | Category | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| [security-hooks](plugins/security-hooks/) | Security | MCP security scanner and protected branch hooks |
| [dev-skills](plugins/dev-skills/) | Development | Skills for Go, documentation, specs, and architecture |
| [git-workflow](plugins/git-workflow/) | Productivity | Commits, pull requests, and changelog maintenance |
| [pm-tools](plugins/pm-tools/) | Productivity | PRDs, task generation, and task tracking |
| [code-quality](plugins/code-quality/) | Development | Code quality analysis, review, and comment cleanup |
| [prompt-tools](plugins/prompt-tools/) | AI | Prompt generation and review |
| [pr-review-triage](plugins/pr-review-triage/) | Workflow | Triage of PR review comments and follow-up tracking |

## Security hooks

Both hooks run on `PreToolUse` and are configured by the plugin manifest, so
there is nothing to wire up by hand.

| Hook | Trigger | Behaviour |
|------|---------|-----------|
| [MCP security scanner](docs/mcp-security-scanner.md) | Any `mcp__*` tool call | Scans requests for API keys, tokens, database URLs, and PII, then logs what it finds |
| [Protected branch hook](docs/protect-main-branch-hook.md) | `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Task` | Blocks writes on `main`, `master`, `production`, and `release`, and tells you to branch first |

Detection patterns live in `.claude/security-patterns.conf`. Copy
`.claude/security-patterns.conf.example` to start from, then add your own.

`pr-review-triage`:

- `/pr-review-triage:triage`: triages unresolved review comments on a PR

## Working on the repository

```bash
make install        # Make the hook scripts executable
make test           # Scanner, branch protection, and marketplace consistency tests
make validate       # Check the plugin manifest, hook scripts, and dependencies
make lint           # ShellCheck and markdownlint
make check-tools    # Report required and optional tools
make status         # Show configuration and tool status
make help           # List every target
```

`jq`, `grep`, `awk`, and `mktemp` are required. `trufflehog`, `gitleaks`, and
`git-secrets` are optional, and improve secret detection when present.

```

Plugin content lives under `plugins/` and nowhere else. Each plugin owns its
manifest in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, which is also where hook wiring is
declared.

### Product management commands

The PM command suite (`/pm-tools:create-prd`, `/pm-tools:generate-tasks`,
`/pm-tools:process-tasks`) is based on patterns and workflows from:

- **Source**: [AI Dev Tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/tree/main)
- **License**: Apache License 2.0. Full text at [LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt)
- **Usage**: Adapted and extended for Claude Code project management workflows

**Statement of changes** (Apache-2.0 §4(b)): the upstream `create-prd.md` and
`generate-tasks.md` have been modified. Changes include restructuring them as
Claude Code slash commands, adding frontmatter, adjusting the task-list format,
and extending the workflow with `process-tasks`. The files in
`plugins/pm-tools/commands/` are not byte-identical to their upstream
originals.

Thanks to the AI Dev Tasks project for the underlying patterns.
