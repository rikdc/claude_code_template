# Product Requirements Document: Prompt Manager

## Introduction/Overview

The Prompt Manager is a web-based application that provides users with a comprehensive interface for analyzing and improving their Claude Code interactions. By intercepting prompts through Claude Code hooks, this tool enables users to critically assess the effectiveness of their prompts through rating, categorization, and conversation management features. The goal is to help individual users become better prompt engineers by providing data-driven insights into their prompting patterns and effectiveness.

## Goals

1. **Prompt Quality Assessment**: Enable users to rate and analyze the effectiveness of their prompts using a 5-star rating system with contextual tagging
2. **Conversation Organization**: Provide tools to view, organize, and split conversation sessions for better analysis
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Capture comprehensive conversation data including prompts, responses, tool calls, and session metadata
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Deliver a clean, intuitive web interface for prompt management and analysis
5. **Future Scalability**: Design architecture to support future team collaboration and centralized database capabilities

## User Stories

1. **As a Claude Code user**, I want to see all my intercepted prompts in a web interface so that I can review my prompting history in one centralized location.

2. **As a prompt engineer**, I want to rate my prompts on a 1-5 scale and add descriptive tags so that I can track which approaches work best for different types of tasks.

3. **As an analyst**, I want to view complete conversation threads (including Claude's responses and tool calls) so that I can understand the full context and effectiveness of my interactions.

4. **As an organizer**, I want to split long conversation sessions into multiple logical sessions so that I can analyze different prompt experiments separately.

5. **As a learner**, I want the system to optionally generate suggested tags for my prompts using AI so that I can discover patterns I might have missed.

6. **As a user seeking improvement**, I want to see my prompt ratings and patterns over time so that I can identify areas for improvement in my prompting skills.

## Functional Requirements

12. The system must provide tag suggestions based on previously used tags
13. The system must optionally connect to Ollama or OpenAI-compatible endpoints to generate AI-suggested tags

### Session Management
14. The system must automatically group related prompts and responses into conversation sessions using Claude Code session IDs
15. The system must provide a "Split Session" button on individual conversation blocks to create new sessions
16. The system must allow users to drag and drop conversation blocks to reorganize sessions
17. The system must maintain original session references while allowing user-defined logical sessions

### Data Storage
18. The system must use SQLite database for local data storage
19. The system must design database schema to support future migration to centralized databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
20. The system must store all conversation data, ratings, tags, and session organization persistently
21. The system must provide database migration capabilities for schema updates

### Hook Integration
22. The system must create new Claude Code hooks for prompt capture without interfering with existing security scanner hooks
23. The system must integrate with the existing Claude Code hook configuration system
24. The system must handle hook failures gracefully without blocking Claude Code operations

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Team Collaboration**: Initial version will not support multiple users or shared prompt libraries
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Complex statistical analysis and machine learning insights are not included
3. **Prompt Optimization Suggestions**: The system will not automatically suggest prompt improvements
4. **Export/Import**: Data export to external formats is not included in initial version
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Live sharing or real-time editing of prompt analysis is not supported
6. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications are not planned
7. **Integration with Other Tools**: Connections to external prompt management or AI tools beyond tag generation

## Design Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go language web service for performance and simplicity
- **Frontend**: Vue.js application for reactive user interface
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage with PostgreSQL-compatible schema design
- **Communication**: RESTful API between frontend and backend

### User Interface
- Clean, minimal design following modern web application patterns
- Conversation threads displayed in chat-like format with clear visual hierarchy
- Prompt cards showing rating, tags, and preview text in grid or list layout
- Modal or sidebar for detailed conversation viewing
- Intuitive controls for rating (star interface) and tagging (tag input with autocomplete)

### Data Architecture
- Structured storage of conversation threads maintaining original Claude Code transcript format
- Separate user-defined sessions linked to original Claude sessions
- Tagging system supporting both user-defined and AI-generated tags
- Rating history tracking for trend analysis

## Technical Considerations

### Claude Code Integration
- Hook implementation must follow existing patterns in `.claude/hooks/` directory
- Configuration updates to `.claude/settings.json` for new hook registration
- Error handling to prevent hook failures from affecting Claude Code operations
- Session ID correlation between hook data and stored conversations

### Database Design
- Schema designed for easy migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Foreign key relationships between conversations, sessions, ratings, and tags
- Indexing strategy for efficient querying of conversation data
- Database versioning system for schema migrations

### Performance Requirements
- Web interface must load within 2 seconds for up to 1000 stored prompts
- Conversation viewing must be responsive for sessions up to 100 exchanges
- Hook execution must not add noticeable delay to Claude Code operations
- Database queries must be optimized for common use cases (recent prompts, highest rated, etc.)

### Security and Privacy
- All data stored locally on user's machine
- No external data transmission except for optional AI tag generation
- AI tag generation endpoints configurable and optional
- Conversation data treated as sensitive user information

## Open Questions

1. **AI Tag Generation**: Which specific Ollama models or OpenAI endpoints should be supported for tag generation? Should we provide model recommendations?

2. **Data Retention**: Should there be automatic cleanup of old conversation data, and if so, what retention period is appropriate?

3. **Backup and Recovery**: What backup mechanisms should be provided for user's prompt analysis data?

4. **Configuration Management**: How should users configure AI endpoints and other system settings? Web interface, config files, or environment variables?

5. **Performance Scaling**: At what point (number of conversations/prompts) should we recommend database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL?

6. **Hook Conflict Resolution**: How should the system handle potential conflicts with existing or future Claude Code hooks?

7. **Session Definition**: Should very short interactions (1-2 exchanges) be automatically grouped with subsequent interactions, or treated as separate sessions?

8. **Tag Standardization**: Should the system suggest a standard taxonomy of tags, or allow completely free-form tagging?
