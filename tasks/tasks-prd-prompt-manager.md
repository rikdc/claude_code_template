### Notes

- Use `go test ./...` from `apps/prompt_manager/` to run all Go backend tests
- Use `npm test` in the `apps/prompt_manager/web/` directory to run Vue.js frontend tests
- Hook scripts must be executable and stored in `apps/prompt_manager/hooks/`
- Database stored at `.claude/apps/prompt_manager/database/prompts.db` for user data persistence
- File-based queue system uses `.claude/apps/prompt_manager/queue/` for ultra-fast hook processing
- Background daemon processes queue files asynchronously to avoid blocking Claude Code operations
- Database migrations should be versioned and support both SQLite and future PostgreSQL compatibility
- You should strive to follow Test-Driven principals were practical. Please create appropriate unit tests as you develop the system.
- Commit often, commit early.
