# Git Workflow Plugin

Git workflow automation skills for commits, PRs, and changelog management.

## Skills Included

### `/git-workflow:commit`

Creates commits with brief conventional commit messages.

**Features**:

- Conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, etc.), no emoji
- Subject-only messages by default; body only when the diff cannot explain the change
- Automatic commit message generation from staged changes
- Suggests splitting when staged changes mix concerns

### `/git-workflow:pr`

Creates a PR on GitHub with proper title and description.

**Features**:

- Analyzes full commit history for the branch
- Generates a concise PR title (under 70 characters, no emoji)
- Writes a succinct description covering only what the branch changes
- Automatically pushes branch if needed

### `/git-workflow:changelog`

Maintains a CHANGELOG.md document following Keep a Changelog format.

**Features**:

- Semantic versioning
- Categorized changes (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
- Automatic date formatting
- Preserves existing changelog structure
