# Claude Command: Commit

Creates well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages.
Runs pre-commit checks and suggests commit splitting when appropriate.

## Usage

To create a commit, just type:

```bash
/commit [--no-verify] [--help]

```

## Workflow

This command spawns parallel sub-tasks for efficiency:

1. **Pre-commit checks** (unless `--no-verify`): Runs `make checks` if available.
2. **Git analysis**: Checks staged files, runs `git diff`, analyzes change patterns
3. **Commit preparation**: Generates conventional commit messages. Omit emoji from commit messages.

If no files are staged, automatically stages all modified files.
If multiple distinct changes are detected, suggests splitting into atomic commits.

## Core Commit Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting/style
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Tests
- `chore`: Tooling, configuration
- `ci`: CI/CD improvements
- `fix`: Fix compiler/linter warnings
- `fix`: Security fixes
- `fix`: Simple non-critical fixes

## Commit Message Format

```markdown
<type>: <description>
[optional body]

```

- Use present tense, imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Each commit should contain related changes serving a single purpose

## Splitting Criteria

Suggests multiple commits when changes involve:

- Different concerns or file types
- Mixed change types (feature + fix + docs)
- Large changes that would be clearer when separated

## Examples

Good commit messages:

- feat: add user authentication system
- fix: resolve memory leak in rendering process
- docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
- refactor: simplify error handling logic

Example split:

- feat: add new API endpoints
- docs: update API documentation
- test: add unit tests for new endpoints

## Options

- `--no-verify`: Skip pre-commit checks

## Notes

- **Pre-commit failures**: Prompts to fix issues or proceed anyway
- **No staged files**: Auto-stages all modified/new files
- **Large changes**: Suggests atomic commits with guided staging
